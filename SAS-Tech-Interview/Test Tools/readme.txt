Either run all of the files individually starting with date_generator -> iso8601_format_check -> regex_chatgpt -> file_comp
		
		or
Just run python file_comp.py while dates.txt is not in this folder. It will create all the necessary files to run.
The last line of True/False will show if the regex and iso utilities in python are equal.
